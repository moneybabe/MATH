\section*{Section 1.1}
\subsection*{Problem 2c}
\begin{proposition}
    $f(x) = -3\cdot tan(2x) + x = 0$ has at least one solution for $x \in [0,1]$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Note that the interval is end point inclusive. 
    We have $f(0) = 0$, which is immediately one solution to the equation.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 2d}
\begin{proposition}
    $f(x) = ln(x)-x^2+\frac{5}{2}x - 1 = 0$ has at least one solution for $x \in [\frac{1}{2},1]$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    $f(\frac{1}{2}) \approx -0.693, f(1) = 0.5$. Hence, by the intermediate value theorem, there 
    exists a solution in the interval.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 4d}
Find interval containing solutions to $x^3 + 4.001x^2 + 4.002x + 1.101 = 0$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
    Since there is no further intructions on the error bound of the interval, we will proceed with 
    the simplest calculus method by finding critical points. Consider the first derivative and set 
    it equal to zero.
    \begin{align*}
        3x^2 + 8.002x + 4.002 & = 0 \\
        x & = \frac{-8.002 \pm \sqrt{8.002^2 - 4\cdot 3\cdot 4.002}}{2\cdot 3} \\
        & \approx \frac{-8 \pm 4}{6} = \frac{-4 \pm 2}{3}.
    \end{align*}

    Now, we can look at both points respectively. $f(-2) = 1.101, f(\frac{-2}{3}) \approx -0.0851$.
    By intermediate theorem, we know that there exists a solution in $[-2, \frac{-2}{3}]$. Now, by 
    simple observation, we can easily conclude that the equation tends to $-\infty$ when $x 
    \rightarrow -\infty$ and tends to $\infty$ when $x \rightarrow \infty$. Hence, by intermediate 
    theorem, there exists one solution in $[-\infty, -2]$ and one in $[\frac{-2}{3}, \infty]$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 6a}
Find $max_{a\le x\le b}|f(x)|$ for $f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2+1}$ on $[0,2]$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
    We proceed by finding the critical points of $f(x)$ on $[0,2]$.

    \begin{align*}
        f'(x) & = \frac{2(x^2+1) - 2x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} \\
              & = \frac{2 - 2x^2}{(x^2+1)^2} \\
              & = 0 \text{ when } x = \pm 1.
    \end{align*}

    Then, we have $f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = \frac{4}{5}$. Hence, the maximum value of $f(x)$ on 
    $[0,2]$ is $1$ when $x=1$.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 14}
Let $f(x) = 2x\cdot cos(2x) - (x-2)^2$ and $x_0 = 0$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Find the third Taylor polynomial $P_3(x)$ and use it to approximate $f(0.4)$.
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        \begin{align*}
            f'(x) & = 2cos(2x) - 4xsin(2x) - 2(x-2), \\
            f''(x) & = -8sin(2x) - 8xcos(2x) - 2 \\
            f'''(x) & = 16xsin(2x) - 24cos(2x).
        \end{align*}

        Now, we have $f(0) = -4, f'(0) = 6, f''(0) = -2, f'''(0) = -24$. Hence, the third Taylor 
        polynomial $P_3(x) = -4 + 6x -x^2 -4x^3$, and $f(0.4) \approx -2.016$.
    \end{proof}

    \item Use the error formula in Taylor's Theorem to find an upper bound for the error 
    $|f(0.4) - P_3(0.4)|$

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        \begin{align*}
            f^4(x) & = 64sin(2x) + 32xcos(2x) \\
            R_3(x) & = \frac{f^4(\xi(x))}{4!}(0.4)^4 \qquad \emph{for } 0 \le \xi(x) \le 0.4.
        \end{align*}

        Hence, \begin{align*}
            |f(0.4) - P_3(0.4)| = |R_3(0.4)| & = \frac{f^4(\xi(x))}{4!}(0.4)^4 \\
            & = \frac{64sin(2\xi(x))-32\cdot \xi(x)cos(2\xi(x))}{24}\times 0.0256 \\
            & \le \frac{64-32\cdot \xi(x)}{24}\times 0.0256 \qquad (\emph{notice } 0 \le sin(2\xi(x)),
            cos(2\xi(x))\le 1)\\
            & \le \frac{64}{24}\times 0.0256 \\
            & \le 0.06827.
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}

    \item Find the third Taylor polynomial $P_4(x)$ and use it to approximate $f(0.4)$.
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        \begin{align*}
            f^4(x) & = 64sin(2x) + 32xcos(2x) \\
            f^4(0) & = 0 \\
            P_4(x) & = -4 + 6x -x^2 \\
            f(0.4) & \approx P_4(0.4) = -2.016.
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}

    \item Use the error formula in Taylor's Theorem to find an upper bound for the error
    $|f(0.4) - P_4(0.4)|$. Compute the actual error.

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        \begin{align*}
            f^5(x) & = 160cos(2x) - 64xsin(2x) \\
            |f(0.4) - P_4(0.4)| = R_4(x) & = \frac{f^5(\xi(x))}{5!}(0.4)^5 \qquad 
            \emph{for } 0 \le \xi(x) \le 0.4. \\
            & \le \frac{160}{5!}\times 0.4^5 \\
            & \le 0.01366.
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 26} 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Use Rolle's Theorem to show that $f'(z_i) = 0$ for $n$ numbers in $[a,b]$ with 
    $a < z_1 < z_2 < \cdots < z_{n} < b$.

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        We are unable to show that without further assumption. Since our goal is proving the 
        Generalized Rolle's Theorem, we will proceed with the assumption that $f(x)$ is $n$ times 
        differentiable on $(a, b)$, and that $f(x) = f(a) = f(b)$ at $n - 1$ distinct numbers such 
        that $a < x_2 < x_3 \cdots < x_n < b$. For clarity, we will also denote $x_1 = a$ and 
        $x_{n+1} = b$ such that $a = x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_{n+1} = b$.

        Now consider each interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ for all $i\in [0, 1, \dots, n]$. Notice that 
        there are $n$ such intervals and $f(x_i) = f(x_{i+1})$. Hence, by 
        Rolle's Theorem, there exists $z_i \in (x_i, x_{i+1})$ such that $f'(z_i) = 0$. Therefore, 
        we can conclude that $f'(z_i) = 0$ for $n$ numbers in $[a,b]$ with $a < z_1 < z_2 < \cdots 
        < z_{n} < b$.
    \end{proof}
    
    \item Use Rolle's Theorem to show that $f''(w_i) = 0$ for $n-1$ numbers in $[a,b]$ with 
    $z_1 < w_1 < z_2 < w_2 \cdots w_{n} < z_{n} < b$.

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        We have shown from (a) that $f'(z_i) = 0$ for $i \in [1, 2, \dots, n]$. Now consider each 
        interval $(z_i, z_{i+1})$ for $i \in [1, 2, \dots, n-1]$. There are $n-1$ such intervals and 
        $f'(z_i) = f'(z_{i+1})$. Hence, by Rolle's Theorem, there exists $w_i \in (z_i, z_{i+1})$ 
        such that $f''(w_i) = 0$. Therefore, we can conclude that $f''(w_i) = 0$ for $n-1$ numbers 
        in $[a,b]$ with $a < z_1 < w_1 < z_2 < w_2 \cdots w_{n-1} < z_{n} < b$.
    \end{proof}

    \item Continue the arguments in parts (a) and (b) to show that for each $j = 1, 2, \dots, n$, 
    there are $n+1-j$ distinct numbers in $[a,b]$, where $f^{(j)}$ is 0.

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        We can easily show by induction on $j$. Base case is already established in (a). Now, assume that 
        $f^{(k)}(y_i) = 0$ for $n+1-k$ distinct numbers in $[a,b]$. Consider each interval $(y_i, 
        y_{i+1})$ for $i\in [1, 2, \dots, n-k]$. There are $n-k$ such intervals and $f^{(k)}(y_i) =
        f^{(k)}(y_{i+1})$. Hence, by Rolle's Theorem, there exists $n-k$ numbers of $u_i \in (y_i, y_{i+1})$ such 
        that $f^{(k+1)}(u_i) = 0$. Therefore, we can conclude that $f^{(k+1)}(u_i) = 0$ for $n-k = 
        n + 1 - (k+1)$ distinct numbers in $[a,b]$. 

        Hence, by induction, we can conclude that for each $j = 1, 2, \dots, n$, there are $n+1-j$
        distinct numbers in $[a,b]$, where $f^{(j)}$ is 0.
    \end{proof}

    \item  Show that part (c) implies the conclusion of the Generalized Rolle's Theorem.
    
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        Notice our only assumptions are that $f(x)$ is $n$ times differentiable on $(a, b)$, and that 
        $f(x) = f(a) = f(b)$ at $n - 1$ distinct numbers such that $a < x_2 < x_3 \cdots < x_n < b$, 
        which is equivalent to saying $f(x)$ is constant for $n+1$ distinct numbers in $[a,b]$. 

        With the mentioned assumptions, we concluded that there are $n+1-j$ distinct numbers in 
        $[a,b]$, where $f^{(j)}$ is 0. Now take $j = n$, we have $n+1-n = 1$ distinct number in 
        $[a,b]$, where $f^{(n)}$ is 0. Hence, we can conclude that there exists $c \in (a,b)$ such 
        that $f^{(n)}(c) = 0$.

        Notice this is exactly what the Generalized Rolle's Theorem says.
    \end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 2c}
Compute the absolute error and relative error in approximations of $p$ by $p^*$: $p = 8!, p^* = 
39900$.

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    \begin{align*}
        |p - p^*| & = 8! - 39900 = 40320 - 39900 = 420. \\
        \frac{|p-p^*|}{p} & = \frac{420}{8!} =\frac{1}{96} \approx 0.0104.
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Problem 4b}
Find the largest interval in which $p^*$ must lie to approximate $p$ with relative error at most 
$10^{-4}$ for $p = e$.
\begin{proof}[Solution]
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{|p^*-e|}{e} & \le 10^{-4} \\
        |p^*-e| & \le 10^{-4}e \\
        |p^* - e| & \le 10^{-4}e \\
        (1-10^{-4})\cdot e & \le p^* \le (1+10^{-4})\cdot e \\
    \end{align*}
